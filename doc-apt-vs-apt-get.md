# Understanding the Difference Between apt and apt-get on Debian-Based Systems

The difference between apt and apt-get mainly comes down to usability and interface, not functionality. Both are command-line tools for managing packages in Debian-based systems like Ubuntu.

### 🧾 Summary Table
| Feature          | `apt`                              | `apt-get`                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Introduced in    | Ubuntu 16.04 (Debian Jessie)       | Much older, traditional tool       |
| User-friendly    | ✅ Yes (cleaner output, progress)  | ❌ No (designed for scripting)     |
| Scripting use    | ⚠️ Not recommended (unstable API)  | ✅ Yes (stable, script-safe)       |
| Progress bars    | ✅ Yes                             | ❌ No                              |

#### ✅ Use apt when:
- You're working interactively on the command line
- You want clearer output and progress indicators
- You're using Ubuntu 16.04+ or Debian Jessie+

**Examples:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl
sudo apt upgrade
```

#### ✅ Use apt-get when:
- Writing scripts or automation tools
- You need backward compatibility with older systems
- You want granular control (e.g. apt-get build-dep)

**Examples:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install curl
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```
